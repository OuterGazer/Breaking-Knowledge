My third Unity game, developed with less than 2 months Unity experience. Based on the Block Breaker section from the GameDev.tv Unity 2D course.

My original additions are:
- Tetris-like block behaviour: The blocks, represented by set of books, fall down into the different shelves randomly.
- Pinball-like paddle behaviour: the player can flip the paddle left or right with left/right mouse clicking. This will speed up the ball, as seen by the change in trail color in the previous gif. If the ball hits the paddle normally it returns to its regular speed, giving the player more control over the ball. Increasing the speed also increases the ball striking power, taking less hits to destroy harder blocks.
- Background music.
- Complete set of menus with a short explanation on controls and gameplay.
- 8 different power-ups ranging from gummy ball to increase ball size/speed, decrease/increase paddle size or even flip the paddle upside down

To play the game download the zip file, extract the files and double click the executable.
